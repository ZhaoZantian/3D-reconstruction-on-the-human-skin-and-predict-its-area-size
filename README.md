These are my undergraduate graduate project which mainly constructs a method to reconstruct a series of images(especially people's wounds) in 3D level, then using our ways to predict and calculate the area of wounds. 
We know that the surface wound of the human skin is uneven, and it is difficult to directly calculate the direct contact measurement or traditional algorithm. 
Therefore, we plan to better predict the area of ​​the wound in combination with computer vision.
